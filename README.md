# Com-Aether

Com-Aether is an end to end messaging app for secure messaging without any tracking. This allows you to communicate with assurance that nobody can peek into your conversations except you and the receiver. It is achieved by only storing the massages locally. The server only acts as a relay to connect to people and communicate back and forth. The communication between 2 peers is completely encrypted and so, even the server can't see any messages.

### Note 
The app is still under development and as of now, its in a bare bones stage where only functionality such as interacting with the server as a user, local message storage and local data encryption are implemented. The basic chatting functionality will soon be implemented.
